# Productive Git for Developers

## 1: Only commit some of my currently modified files into the repository

`git status` shows files that have been changed.
`git add file1 file` will let you add multiple files to the commit. Can also use `git add src/app/app*` to add e.g. `app.js` and `app.ts` without typing out name of each file.
Now can just commit those files with `commit -m 'change App files'`.
Or just use `git add .` for all of them.
`git log` shows the commit history.
